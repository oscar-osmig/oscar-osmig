## Fun Fact 🌟
Before starting college, I was torn between studying *Architecture* and *Software Engineering. The turning point came when my math teacher introduced me to a game called **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. The logic and strategic thinking involved in the game sparked my interest in problem-solving and algorithm design, which ultimately led me to choose **Software Engineering* as my major. It was the perfect blend of creativity and logic, and I've never looked back since.
