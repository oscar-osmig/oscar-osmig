## 🌟 Fun Fact

Before I pursued a career in **Software Engineering**, I was torn between studying **Architecture** and **Engineering**. The pivotal moment came when my math teacher introduced me to a challenging game called **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe**. The logic and strategy of the game inspired me to dive deeper into algorithm design and problem-solving, ultimately leading me to choose Software Engineering. It was the perfect mix of creativity and logic, and I haven’t looked back since!
