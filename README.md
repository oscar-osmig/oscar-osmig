## <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">🌟 Fun Fact</span>

Before I pursued a career in <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, I was torn between studying <strong>Architecture</strong> and <strong>Engineering</strong>. The pivotal moment came when my math teacher introduced me to a challenging game called <strong>Ultimate Tic Tac Toe</strong>. The logic and strategy of the game inspired me to dive deeper into algorithm design and problem-solving, ultimately leading me to choose Software Engineering. It was the perfect mix of creativity and logic, and I haven’t looked back since!
